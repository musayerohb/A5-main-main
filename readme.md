We did collaborate a bit with other people in TA Hours like Angelica and Tianah, but not extensively.

Reflections:

Eva's Reflection:

What worked well was implementing new methods that solved issues we had in the larger methods required of us for this assingment. For example, the isRightAssociation method proved helpful as it allowed the exponentiation to work properly in the calculateResult method even though we didn't expect to need any more methods. However, I could see this becoming overwhelming in future assignments as I might become limited by my own knowledge on what I can and cannot apply methods for.

What I'd like to try differently is working on the methods in a more chronological order, if possible. I felt that after a while, working on the Postfix class at the same time as the Calculate class caused me to get mixed up occasionally on where one's functionality ended and the other's began. I know this can't be avioded for some assignments, but I'm going to try and be vigilant for when it can so I can prevent myself from getting the placement of methods mixed up.

Musa's Reflection:

I learned about comparing precedence, and what worked pretty well was making methods like parenOrOp methods which helped clean up our code and better categorize what each portion of the program did and what tools it needed to be able to do them.

I realized I didn't end up tracing back many steps on my own in the program, so debugging was difficult at times, especially in this case since we were working with so many connected methods. For future assignments, I want to be better at utilizing the debug function in the code editor while finalizing the program, especially since it ended up pointing out issues in the code that we hadn't detected even after doing lots of manual debugging.
